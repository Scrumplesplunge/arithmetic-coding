A small and simple arithmetic coding implementation for C++. This does not
attempt to be fast: it merely implements the algorithm as described on Wikipedia
with minimal changes, and in an object-oriented manner.

Compilation:

Simply compile all source files and link together. A makefile is provided.

Usage:

./arithmetic encode < plaintext_input > compressed_output
./arithmetic decode < compressed_input > plaintext_output
